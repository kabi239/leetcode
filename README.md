# LeetCode Practice Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode Practice Repository! This repository is a collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems as I practice data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are:

- To track my progress and improvement over time.
- To serve as a reference for future problem-solving.
- To document solutions in a clear and understandable manner for anyone interested in learning.

## Languages Used

I will be solving problems in the following programming languages:

- Python
- Java
